On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	bkh788/bkh_noadd.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation:
'git status' basically does what it says: it displays the status of the repo,
including the working directory and the staging area. The output here
indicates that my working directory is up to date with the repo, and I have
an untracked file "bkh_noadd.txt". This file is untracked because I did not
add it.
